          <h3>About Me</h3> <!-- about me section -->
          <p>After high school I joined the work force, shortly thereafter I found a company that needed assistance
            with data transfer from an old inventory system to a new one, I've always been drawn to computer work so I
            gave it a shot. Turns out it was something I loved doing, and once the data transfer was completed I
            created a training manual for the company and stayed on running their inventory system until eventually
            they closed the location I was working out of.</p> <!-- paragraph -->
          <p>I then went to work for Walmart, and that is where I worked up until earlier this year when my position
            was eliminated due to COVID related changes. I started as a stocker and quickly rose to department
            manager. After doing that for about a year I was given an opportunity to go to the Walmart Academy(where
            they train all new managers for our region) as a trainer. Again after about a year I promoted to Assistant
            Store Manager moving over to the Sam's Club side of things. I did that for about a year and a half before
            the COVID changes occurred earlier this year, and being the least tenured it left me on the outs.</p>
          <!-- paragraph -->
          <p>All of this has given me an opportunity to choose a new path in life, one that I feel very excited to
            pursue with Thinkful.</p> <!-- paragraph -->
          <p>I will be able to help you design professional web pages and web apps using a variety of different coding
            languages and methods(will include more specifics as I update portfolio throughout the course).          </p>
          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer with plenty of business experience I would love to hear from
            you!</p> <!-- paragraph -->

              <p>The purpose of this project is to help the user find the optimal gear for their World of Warcraft character during the launch window of their most recent release.
                This was my first major project where I wrote a both a front end and a back end utilizing React and Node.js/Express.
                I learned a great deal about writing sql queries and migrations during this project.

              <p>This app was designed for people to keep track of their medications in one easy to view place.
                It utilizes a client side and a server/api that were both written by me.
                The client side was written using React(with React Hooks), the API portion was written using Node.js
              with Express/Knex(Postgres). I learned alot during this project about working with user
            authentication in conjunction with api calls.</p>

              <p>The function of this project is to help the user learn words in Norwegian through spaced repetition. This project was built using React for the Front end, and node.js/express on the back end. This was
                one of the first projects that I got to personally add a login function to my apps, so I learned alot
                on that front in creating this app.

              <p>The function of this app is to be able to join a queue to adopt a pet, and then when it becomes the users turn, pick a pet and get confirmation.
                This project was built using React for the Front end, and node.js/express on the back end. This project
                utilizes linked lists, and was a great way for me to get some hands on experience in coding with them
                over the more commonly utilitzed objects/arrays.
